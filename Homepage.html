          <Strong> What are the benefits to electric vehicles</Strong> <p> You may be wondering why we champion electric vehicles as our savior and there is actually a very simple reason why. The fossil fuels that we use to power our cars today are not sustainable long term because fossil fuels are a limited resource. This means that we have no way of recreating them to sustain the demand. What is a renewable resource however is electricity. This can be harvested through many ways; for example we can use wind turbines, build dams to harness hydropower, and use solar panels to harness the sun. The sustainability that electricity brings to the table is why its a such a good option for now and for the future. Shown below are the brands that are leading the pack when it comes to devloping electric vehicles.(and coincidentally the ones we sell) </p>

            <strong>BMW's Electric Future</strong>
            <p>While BMW was one of the first car manufacturers ever, they are moving more slowly into electric vehicles. However, that does not mean that these cars are of worse quality but actually of better. BMW is known for combining sporty driving mechanics with luxury interior in a really classy way and that is what they are doing and plan to do in the future with their electric lineup.</p>

            <strong >Tesla: Pioneers</strong>    
            <p> Tesla was one of the first ever all electric car companies, and certainly the most successful. Founded in 2003 in San Carlos, California, tesla had a slow start to the car business, not releasing their first car, the roadster, until 2008. Tesla is not only a car company but their owner, Elon Musk, is using Teslas profits to develop more efficient batteries that are made of 92% recyled metals and also developing solar panels that look exactly like roof shingles. This ingenious innovation is how tesla plans to make the future electric.</p>
